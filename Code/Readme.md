# How to use the database
You first need to uncompress the .zip file which will give you a folder called ModularSymbols and also you have to uncompress the file called allbsd. The allbsd file is part of the Cremona database for the full database see https://zenodo.org/records/7194436. The folder ModularSymbols contains .txt file. Each file is a python dictionary. The keys of this dictionary is a *string* of the form [a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5] where $a_1,...,a_5$ are the "a" invariants of the elliptic curve E. Now, the values of the string "[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5]" is another dictionary. In this case the keys are the primes for which E has multiplicative reduction. The reason why primes of non-split multiplicative reduction appear in the database was an oversight at the moment of creating the database. Thus, the user need to check if the prime p is a prime of split multiplicative reduction or non-split multiplicative reduction. This can be done with the command E.has_split_multiplicative_reduction(p) to check if it is a primes of split multiplicative reduction or not. 
Finally, the values associated to the key "p" is the list [\lambda(a,p)] where a = 1,...,p-1, 0. The value of \lambda(0,p) is the *last* value of the list, not the first.
